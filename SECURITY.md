## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason other than for demonstrating the issue
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third party

We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy.
